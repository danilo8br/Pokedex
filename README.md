<p align="center">In this project, I created a Pokedex inspired by Pok√©mon using Python, Flask, HTML, CSS and PokeAPI to develop the project.</p>


## :rocket: About the project
I watched Pokemon when I was a kid, so to remember the old days I decided to do something related to drawing.

## :wrench: How it works?
As the user informs the name of the pokemon, it shows the Pokemon and its types.

## :warning: Prerequisites
You need to get PokeAPI
